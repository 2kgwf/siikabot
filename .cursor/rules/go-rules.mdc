# Rules for logging

- Always use zerolog
- Always include the current context
- All relevant variables should be added as log fields
- Log fields should always use snake_case
- Never use dynamic or changing text in the message

For example:

```go
log.Error().Ctx(ctx).Err(err).Str("recipient", recipient).Int("attempt_count", attemptCount).Msg("Failed to send a message")
```
